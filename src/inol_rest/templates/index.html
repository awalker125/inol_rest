					<h2>Design</h2>
					<p>In order to get strong you must lift heavy weights but it is the recovery that actually makes you stronger. If you do not lift enough there will be insufficent stimulus to cause the body to adapt. If you lift to much you will not be able to recover and actually end up weaker or more likely injured. So how should you design a training program that works without wasting time or getting
						injured?</p>
					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>In the 1970s weightlifitng coach Alexander Sergeyevitch Prilepin analysed the training logs of many athletes in an attempt to answer the 'How much should I lift?' question. He devised a table that shows the optimal rep ranges for olympic athletes per set and across an entire workout for maximal strength gains.</p>
					<div>

						<!-- Table -->
						<table class="table">
							<tbody>

								<tr>
									<td><strong>Intensity</strong></td>
									<td><strong>Reps per se</strong>t</td>
									<td><strong>Recommended optimal Total of Reps</strong></td>
									<td><strong>Range of reps seen in research</strong></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Below 70%</td>
									<td>3 &#8211; 6</td>
									<td>24</td>
									<td>18-30</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>70 &#8211; 79%</td>
									<td>3 &#8211; 6</td>
									<td>18</td>
									<td>12 &#8211; 24</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>80 &#8211; 89%</td>
									<td>2 &#8211; 4</td>
									<td>15</td>
									<td>10 &#8211; 20</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>90% and above</td>
									<td>1 &#8211; 2</td>

									<td>4 &#8211; 10</td>
								</tr>

					<p>There are a couple of problems with the table which reduce its usefulness. Firstly it does not go beyond 6 reps. This is probably because lifts like snatch and clean and jerk are typically never performed above that rep range. Everyone does sets of 10 on bench and squat so how does this apply? Secondly what would you do if your session included intensities from two or more ranges. e.g
						75%, 85%, 92%. Hristo Hristov wrote a paper entitled "How to Design Strength Training Programs Using Prilepin's Table". In it he devises a formula called the inol (Intensity x Number Of Lifts) which resolves these problems.</p>
						<p>The equation is given below where set inol (n) is a function of the number of reps (r) at an intensity (i):
					<span>$$ n = \frac{r}{100-i} $$</span>
					<p>We can describe the exercise inol (N) as a function of the number of set (s) at a particular set inol (n):
					<span>$$ N = {s}{n} $$</span>
					<p>To give a concrete example. Someone with a 1 rep max bench press of 175kg performs a set of 8 reps at 140kg. The set inol would be calculated as:</p> 
					<span>$$ n = \frac{8}{100-((140/175)*100)}$$</span>
					<span>$$ n = \frac{8}{100-((0.8)*100)}$$</span>
					<span>$$ n = \frac{8}{100-80}$$</span>
					<span>$$ n = \frac{8}{20}$$</span>
					<span>$$ n = 0.4$$</span>
					<p>If 3 sets were performed at this then the exercise inol would be:</p>
					<span>$$ N = {3}*{0.4} $$</span>
					<span>$$ N = 1.2 $$</span>
